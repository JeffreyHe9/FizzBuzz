## Description
This project implements the FizzBuzz challenge, a common programming task often used in software developer job interviews. The program iterates through numbers 1 to 100 and applies the following rules:
- Prints "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
- Prints "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
- Prints "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
- Prints the number itself if none of the above conditions are met

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fizzbuzz.git
2. No additional dependencies are required as this project uses only Python's built-in functionality.
